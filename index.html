      <h2>üçï Interesting Pizza Facts</h2>
      <p>One of the first purchases that was recorded on the Internet was a pizza with pepperoni sausage, mushrooms and double cheese.</p>
      <p>A group of hackers in 2012 briefly blocked the site of a pizzeria for the fact that their pizza was delivered as much as 2 hours later than the time announced by the operator.</p>
      <p>The very first pizzeria was opened in 1738 in the city of Naples in Italy. She had the name "Antika".</p>
      <p>Pizza even has its own professional holiday called Pizzafest. It is held, of course, in Italy, but guests from all over the world come to the celebration.</p>
